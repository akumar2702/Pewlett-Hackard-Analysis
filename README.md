# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Analysis

### The purpose of this challenge was to test what we learned in PostGres SQL by helping Bobby find out how many employees are retiring from the company. We had to make tables with different components and group and order the tables according to what we were told. SQL is an easier way to create tables and is used by many companies. 

## Results

* ### Retiring Table - 7 titles
#### We can see that senior engineers and senior staff are the largest numbers to retire.
